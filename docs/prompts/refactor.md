# Tips

Approach:

1. Incremental Refactoring: Paste <200 LOC chunks for best results
2. Behavior Locking: Add "Verify via test: [TEST NAME]" comments

Inputs:

1. The file to refactor + files in the same package
2. Project structure (directories and .go files)
3. Unit test files for this file or package
4. `go.mod` contents â€” module name, Go version, dependencies
